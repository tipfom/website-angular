To measure the profile of the ion beam in the particle accelerator one could use a plain oscilloscope, but this technique renders several issues: It is hard to compare the beam at different stages of the particle accelerator and qualitative assessment of the signal is hard and would require manual labor. The developed software solves all these problems by processing the raw signal acquired from an digital oscilloscope, presenting it in real time and computing several characteristic measures of the beam. Therefore the work to calibrate the beam could be reduced."
